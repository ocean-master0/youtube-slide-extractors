## üìù Usage

### Single Video Mode

1. Launch the application: `python main.py`
2. Enter a YouTube URL in the "YouTube URL" field
3. Adjust parameters as needed:
   - Frame Interval: How often to check for new slides (in seconds)
   - Similarity Threshold: How different frames need to be to count as new slides (0.0-1.0)
   - Video Resolution: Quality of the downloaded video
4. Select your preferred export format (PDF, HTML, or Images)
5. Click "Extract Slides" and wait for processing to complete
6. Use "Open Output Folder" to view the extracted slides

### Batch Processing Mode

1. Switch to the "Batch Processing" tab
2. Add multiple YouTube URLs using the input field and "Add URL" button
3. Configure batch settings (similar to single video mode)
4. Enable/disable parallel processing as needed
5. Click "Start Batch Processing"
6. Monitor progress in the batch log
7. Access all extracted slides in the output folder

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Frame Interval
- Lower values (1-2 seconds) catch more slides but take longer to process
- Higher values (5+ seconds) are faster but might miss some slides

### Similarity Threshold
- Lower values (0.7) detect more slides, including slightly different ones
- Higher values (0.9) only detect significantly different slides

### Resolution
- Higher resolutions provide better quality slides but take longer to download
- Recommended: 720p for a good balance of quality and speed

### Export Formats
- **PDF**: Creates a single document with all slides
- **HTML**: Creates an interactive slideshow viewable in any browser
- **Images Only**: Saves each slide as a separate PNG file
